    <string name="string_about_app">Life simulation is a game built on the model of cellular automaton. The essence of the model is as follows: there is a field with cells. The cell can be alive or dead. A cell comes to life if it has 3 living neighbors. A cell can die if the number of neighbors becomes less than 2 or more than 3.\nIn the current version of the app, a field with cells is created filled in randomly. In the future, the function of drawing on the field will be added, which will allow you to create any initial configuration of living cells.</string>
